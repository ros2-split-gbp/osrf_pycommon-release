ros-humble-osrf-pycommon (2.0.1-2jammy) jammy; urgency=high

  * Don't release 2.x / master on Debian Buster. (#83 <https://github.com/osrf/osrf_pycommon/issues/83>)
    Debian Buster is on Python 3.7: https://packages.debian.org/buster/python3
  * Stop using mock in favor of unittest.mock. (#74 <https://github.com/osrf/osrf_pycommon/issues/74>)
    Mock has been deprecated since Python 3.3; see
    https://pypi.org/project/mock/ .  The recommended replacement
    is unittest.mock, which seems to be a drop-in replacement.

  * Fix dependencies (#81 <https://github.com/osrf/osrf_pycommon/issues/81>)
    * Remove obsolete setuptools from install_requires
    Now that pkg_resources are no longer used, there is no need to depend
    on setuptools at runtime.
    * Fix version-conditional dependency on importlib-metadata
    Use version markers to depend on importlib-metadata correctly.  Explicit
    conditions mean that wheels built with setup.py will either have the dep
    or not depending on what Python version they're built with, rather than
    what version they're installed on.
  * fix whitespace and date in changelog heading

ros-humble-osrf-pycommon (2.0.0-2jammy) jammy; urgency=high

  * Replace the use of ``pkg_resources`` with the more modern ``importlib-metadata``. (#66 <https://github.com/osrf/osrf_pycommon/issues/66>)
    * Note this means that from now on you can only release on >= Ubuntu focal as that was when ``python3-importlib-metadata`` was introduced.
    * Used the ``1.0.x`` branch if you need an ealier version that still uses ``pkg_resources``.
